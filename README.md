This repository contains all data and code needed to re-do the Joint Species Distribution Model, and linked figures and analyses in our manuscript:

This folder is a RStudio project folder, and the script uses the `here` package (see also [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)) to further ensure all files paths are relative.

**Note**: following reviewer's comments, an additional analysis was made by the senior author. This analysis is included here in its self-contained subfolder (`suppl_RDA_DBonte`).
