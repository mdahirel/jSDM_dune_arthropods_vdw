This folder contains a bunch of custom functions aiming to make post-processing of Hmsc::Hmsc() models more tidy

IMPORTANT: 
- these have not been tested for models beyond the ones in this project repository, models with different structure could break them;
- they are also not optimised for speed, at all, you may have to wait a bit while some run;
- especially for the `HMSCfitted()` function, the output and memory use may be quite big if model and dataset are big
